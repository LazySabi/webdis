          <h2>Ph1LzA</h2>
          <p>
            Philza, also known as Phil, is the twenty fifth member of the Dream
            SMP, joining on November 16, 2020, counting Mexican Dream making him
            the twenty sixth member. He is a former L'Manberg resident and a
            member of The Syndicate. He is the father of Wilbur Soot and
            grandfather of Fundy.
          </p>

          <p>
            While Phil helped L'Manberg on multiple occasions, he did not
            support the government. He first joined the server in an attempt to
            stop Wilbur from destroying L'Manberg during the Manberg vs Pogtopia
            War.[4] He failed to stop Wilbur, but helped kill the withers during
            the battle and accepted Tubbo's request to help rebuild and live in
            L'Manberg afterward.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, while living in L'Manberg, he openly disagreed with the
            government's actions and often visited his longtime friend
            Technoblade, an enemy of L'Manberg. He further opposed the
            government after the Butcher Army put him under house arrest and
            attempted to execute Techno. As a result, after Techno broke him out
            of house arrest, Phil moved in with him. He fought on Techno and
            Dream's side in the Doomsday War, which he hoped would "send a
            message" to the L'Manberg's inhabitants. He directly contributed to
            the destruction of L'Manberg by spawning withers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Phil is currently a member of The Syndicate, an organization formed
            by Techno that seeks to keep the server in an anarchist state and
            eliminate any threat of government.
          </p>

          <div class="information-container-small">
            <h3 id="appearance">Appearance</h3>
            <p>
              Phil is a human with light skin, blue eyes, and dirty blond hair.
              His default skin is a green jinbei, a black undershirt with a red
              heart, black haori, a red belt, sandals, and a green-and-white
              striped bucket hat with an emerald hanging off of it. The skin is
              based on Kisuke Urahara from the anime/manga Bleach.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phil's winter clothing is very similar to Techno's, consisting of
              a steel chest plate, maroon arm wear, white shoulder pads, black
              boots and navy blue pants. His trademark hat is also replaced with
              a blue scale replica of it.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="information-container-small">
            <h3 id="biology">Biology</h3>
            <p>
              Although not shown on his Minecraft skin, Phil is canonically
              depicted with wings that are typically dark gray or black in
              color, as a reference to his affinity for his elytra in his
              Hardcore world. Though it began as a fan-centric design, Phil
              later confirmed it to be canon. As a result of his shielding
              Wilbur from the first detonation of L'Manberg, they are injured
              beyond repair, and subsequently unusable. He has also stated that
              if he were to canonically die, his ghost form could see a return
              of these wings, depicted in-game in the form of an elytra
              permanently bound to his back.
            </p>
            <p>
              Phil only has one life on the server despite not having any
              "canon" deaths. This is because of his popular reputation for
              streaming Minecraft in the hardcore mode where you cannot respawn
              when you die. Phil is the only person on the server to have one
              life by default. Phil has also lived for centuries.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="information-container-big">
          <h2 id="personality">Personality</h2>
          <p>
            Of all the SMP members, Phil is one of the most respected and seen
            as relatively powerful despite not holding official titles in any
            nation.
          </p>

          <p>
            >Usually, he is resilient, kind, and hard-working, taking care to
            complete mundane tasks such as filling creeper craters and repairing
            paths. He initially appeared to be peaceful, lending a hand to
            people in need. Despite this, Phil is far from a pacifist, not
            afraid to shed his peaceful nature and resume his classic chaotic
            attitude when pressured by the people around him.
          </p>

          <p>
            Phil is a no-nonsense person, wise and willing to discipline people
            if they break rules or cause problems. He is easily exasperated at
            their chaos, and not hesitant to leave people to deal with the
            consequences if they continue to act up despite his intervention and
            warning.
          </p>

          <p>
            Phil is efficient and seeks to solve problems in the most
            straightforward way possible - for example, when he identified that
            L'Manberg was the corruptive force behind Wilbur's spiral into
            madness, and the violence of the Butcher Army, he sought to end it
            as soon as possible by assisting in its destruction. Phil is not
            afraid of taking a stance when he needs to.
          </p>

          <p>
            Though he works for the betterment of people as a whole, this broad
            perspective of the world blinds Phil to nuance, as demonstrated by
            his failure to show empathy to Ghostbur in the aftermath of
            Doomsday.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="information-container-big">
          <h2 id="ideology">Ideology</h2>
          <p>
            Initially, Phil's ideology was unclear as a result of his lack of
            knowledge about the political landscape of the Dream SMP. However,
            after working alongside Tubbo to repair L'Manberg, Phil realized
            that government might not be a great idea and started to reconsider
            his stance on Technoblade's brand of anarchy, especially after
            watching Tubbo steal from others in the name of "taxing."
          </p>

          <p>
            After being questioned, Phil explained that he wasn't necessarily
            against government, but only if it helps the people. He noted that
            on the server, government had consistently failed the people rather
            than helped them - Phil seems to desire a better world for the
            people as a whole.
          </p>

          <p>
            After being placed under house arrest and having his home vandalized
            by the Butcher Army, Phil now fully shares Technoblade's ideal of an
            anarchist world, having come to strongly dislike the L'Manberg
            government, as he has seen it turn good people into tyrants. Phil is
            willing to embrace his friend's chaos in the pursuit of a truly free
            server. He understands anarchy is more than chaos and violence, and
            has his own reasons for pursuing anarchy beyond Techno's.
          </p>

          <p>
            Phil does not regret Doomsday, saying that while he understands
            L'Manberg was important to people, it needed to happen. He believes
            people are more important than possessions, a perspective shaped by
            his experiences of loss after being alive for centuries.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, Phil's ideology is simple: if a system of law does good for
            the people, it can remain. If a system of law oppresses the people
            and does no good, that system must be abolished.
          </p>
          <div class="information-container-small">
            <h3 id="philzas-age">Philza's age</h3>
            <p>
              Phil being centuries old is something that shapes both his
              personal ideology and social interactions. He has spoken to Sam
              about how the grief of watching his loved ones die weighs on him
              greatly, but he made those who hurt them suffer just as much.
            </p>

            <p>
              It has also shaped his moral beliefs, he greatly values people
              over property and items, which impacted both his decision to
              participate in Doomsday, and his thoughts about it afterward. Phil
              has not confirmed if his character is immortal or not, only saying
              that his character only knows he hasn’t died. Phil often
              references the possibility he will die in the future, saying
              "when, not if," although his desire to originally possibly play
              himself in Tales from the SMP: The Pit is in tension with this.

        <div class="information-container-big">
          <h2 id="philzas-crow">Philza's crows</h2>
          <p>
            Phil stated that his Twitch chat is represented in the SMP as a
            murder of crows only he (and Kristin) can understand. These crows
            retcon Phil having voices in his head, making his chat no longer
            representing disembodied voices. These crows follow him around, and
            he has to calm them constantly.

            The bits the chat donates are trinkets the crows bring him, and the
            channel/subscriber badges are necklaces he's given different crows.

              Phil has stated he is incredibly old, being hundreds if not
              thousands of years old and in this time, he has met many people,
              such as his old friend Technoblade, and seen fantastical things,
              one of them possibly being method of resurrecting people from the
              dead, as well as seeing the rise and fall of civilizations, and
              that he experienced great grief upon the death of his family and
              friends, though that this pain was "not as great as the pain he
              inflicted upon their enemies". Phil has said he does not know if
              he is immortal, but is yet to die.
            </p>

            <p>
              Phil has alluded to his times in SMPEarth while on the server. He
              was the co-leader of the Antarctic Empire with Technoblade, and
              helped him take over the entire server. To what degree this is
              canon is questionable, as he stated that his past with the
              Antarctic Empire is only a headcannon.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sometime in the 1970's, Phil got "down and dirty" with the Unnamed
              Samsung Smart Fridge, giving birth to Wilbur, Wilbur exchanged
              letters with Phil about his time on the server. These letters were
              the primary reason why Phil joined, as he grew concerned over his
              son's health. However, Phil's recount of the letters does not
              match up with history; according to the letters, Wilbur won the
              Election and Schlatt never existed.

              Shortly before Phil joined, he was on his hardcore world and in a
              call with Wilbur, who was about to push the button. Phil attempted
              to console Wilbur and prevent him from pushing it. When he failed,
              he then logged onto the SMP to physically stop Wilbur from pushing
              the button. However, Wilbur pushed it, and afterward told Phil to
              kill him, which he did reluctantly.

              Shortly after the war, Phil helped Technoblade assassinate George

                During the Reconstruction Era, Phil decided to help L'Manberg
                rebuild, also joining them to help finish The Guardian XP Farm.
                However, he stated that he was remaining neutral, unwilling to
                officially pick sides. Despite this, Tubbo granted a small plot
                of land near Tommy's L'Manbergian house for Phil's use.
              </p>

              <p>
                A few days after the war, Phil went mining near Technoblade's
                old base to get supplies. He was interrupted by Fundy, who
                wanted to trade coal for Karl's pet polar bear. This led to a
                small auction where Fundy attempted to con him into trading an
                empty chest for ores and materials. After this, Phil returned to
                mining, but was later interrupted by Tommy, who was showing a
                newly logged in Connor around. After the brief interaction, Phil
                went back to mining. He mined for over eight hours, but didn't
                build a base.
              </p>

              <p>
                Days later, Phil built his house in L'Manberg and spent time
                with Ghostbur, who asked him to write a book for his collection.
                In the book, Phil shared that he felt great remorse for killing
                his son.
              </p>

              <p>
                While helping Tubbo gather obsidian, Phil discovered that the
                L'Mantree had been stripped of its leaves by an unknown vandal.
                After receiving reference images from his chat, he rebuilt the
                L'Mantree exactly the way it was before leaving to mine
                netherite. During netherite-mining session, Phil got a call from
                Fundy, who was distraught over Eret not showing up to finalize
                his adoption. Seeing how upset Fundy was over the whole thing,
                Phil traveled back to the overworld to comfort him, gave him a
                bed in his house, and took him fishing.

              <p>
                Phil resided in L'Manberg, but questioned where his loyalties
                lay. He enjoyed Tubbo's company and was proud of him for
                rebuilding L'Manberg greater than before. He started to question
                Tubbo's leadership, however, as Tubbo would steal from his
                citizens under the pretense of "taxes" for use on his personal
                projects, and created a "panic room" in which he would abandon
                his country in case of any danger. On the other hand, Techno was
                a much more honorable figure in Phil's eyes and had a much
                longer history as a friend, and Phil missed his companionship.
                His support for Techno became more open as he dressed in the
                same winter garb and painted his shield the colors of the
                Antarctic Empire.
              </p>
              <p>
                Phil later helped Techno transport his pets Hubert and Fool to
                his new base. After arriving and moving them into the basement,
                Techno told Phil he considered him to be his only friend and
                gifted him the Friendship Emeralds and Techno's compass. The
                compass pointed to a Lodestone in Techno's base far away from
                Dream SMP and L'Manberg. Techno also told Phil that if he was
                ever in trouble, Techno would come to his aid. Later on, Phil
                helped Techno build a turtle farm and a bee farm.

              <p>
                The Butcher Army's decision to execute Technoblade started the
                search for him. With the knowledge that Phil was Technoblade's
                best friend, they sought information about his location from
                him. However, when they arrived at his house to question him, he
                refused to give any clues to Techno's whereabouts. As a result,
                they ransacked Phil's house, vandalizing it while searching for
                evidence. Tubbo found Techno's compass and put Phil under house
                arrest for refusing to cooperate. Phil was given an ankle
                monitor (a pair of iron boots named "Ankle Monitor") to ensure
                he could not leave the house. After they left, he placed the
                ankle monitor on an item stand and followed the Butcher Army,
                and witnessed their seizure of Techno. He managed to sneak back
                before the Butcher Army noticed. Upon the Butcher Army's return
                to L'Manberg with Techno, Phil stood on his balcony to watch the
                event. Throughout the execution and escape, Phil mocked the
                Butcher Army's failure and was shot by an enraged Tubbo. Phil
                began to show open disgust at the new government and became
                convinced that power had twisted these people, and that they
                needed to be taught a lesson.
              </p>

              <p>
                Three days after his house arrest began, Tubbo visited and gave
                him a pair of new Ankle Monitor boots that were un-removable
                (they were enchanted with the curse of binding). He was nearly
                given an un-removable helmet as well, but Ghostbur and later
                Tubbo accidentally put it on, leading to Phil not having to wear
                it.
              </p>

              <p>
                During Phil's house arrest, he was unable to do anything outside
                the boundaries of his home. However, he had the idea to expand
                underneath his basement because according to Fundy, it is legal
                to expand above or below one's house as long as it is within the
                property. As Phil knew how to break bedrock, he planned to do so
                beneath his house, creating a void basement.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the last days of house arrest, Phil managed to break his
                ankle monitor, using a magma block to lower its durability until
                it broke. He then escaped to the catacombs below the house and
                came out behind his base underneath the railway. Phil also
                attempted to return Technoblade's items, but Techno’s items were
                not in Tubbo’s bunker as he thought. Phil finally escaped
                L'Manberg with the help of Techno and his potions, fleeing to
                his cabin in the Arctic.

                After their escape, Techno showed Phil his second vault, where
                Phil agreed that the government did nothing good. In the days
                leading up to the war, Phil built a nether wart farm. Upon
                hearing of Tommy's betrayal at the Green Festival, he tore down
                Tommy's cobblestone tower.

                Techno, Phil, and Dream went to destroy the nation once and for
                all, where Phil and Dream played ranged support while Techno
                fought on the ground. When Techno fired off the signal (Firework
                rockets the colors of the anarchist flag), Phil spawned the
                first wave of withers and joined in on the chaos. Both Phil and
                Techno told Ranboo that he could leave and be safe. After the
                battle, Phil realized that Friend had died, and Ghostbur yelled
                at him for tearing down the nation. Later, however, Ghostbur
                forgot this bad memory, and asked Phil to take part in his
                resurrection. Phil stated that he had limited knowledge of
                necromancy, and would need time to study. However, Ghostbur
                insisted that the ritual must take place on January 10, and Phil
                reluctantly agreed. Later, Phil remembered Ranboo, inviting him
                to move to the Arctic, which he accepted. Phil then started on
                plans to house both Ranboo and the survivors of the Hound Army.

                resurrection attempt in recreating the time when he killed his

                Undying in order to complete the resurrection, as his readings
                described the Totem as not preventing a true death, but
                restoring life to the holder and nearby individuals when they
                die. Though Phil knew that Techno still had a totem, Techno
                wasn't around and he felt hesitant to take it for Wilbur's sake.

                On April 29, Ranboo visited Phil and told him of the events
                leading up to Wilbur's resurrection. At first, Phil expressed
                happiness that Wilbur was revived, and asked how Wilbur was
                feeling. Ranboo also revealed that Wilbur was happy to see Tommy
                and Tubbo, but believed that he created the crater at L'Manberg.
                Wilbur also recognized Ghostbur on the train, indicating that
                they were two separate entities. Ranboo explained that Wilbur is
                happy, but was stuck in the afterlife for what he experienced
                for around thirteen years. Phil then stated that Wilbur might
                have become a different person, as that long of a time alone can
                hurt. Phil said that he needed to be ready for when Wilbur would
                visit him. Phil told Ranboo that he might know where Wilbur
                could be and then headed off to go find Wilbur, leaving Ranboo
                at his base.
              </p>

                When Phil arrived at the crater of L'Manberg, he did not find
                Wilbur, but did find Fundy. Though Fundy is his grandson, their
                relationship had become strained after Phil's house arrest, and
                they had not spoken in some time. Phil shared the news about
                Wilbur's possible resurrection, and they decided to search
                together. The pair explored the different parts of the server
                which were shaped by Wilbur, and failed to see any sign of him
                but reconnected over memories of their lost family. Phil
                mentioned how Wilbur sent him letters before his arrival on the
                server, and recalls the letter Wilbur wrote to him after he won
                the Election. Fundy, confused, told Phil the truth: Wilbur never
                won the election and was forcibly exiled by Jschlatt. They
                pondered over why Wilbur might have sent letters containing
                false information to Phil, and resolved to ask him if they found
                him. As the search turned up nothing, the grandfather and
                grandson returned to their separate homes, and prepared for a
                painful reunion with their lost family member.

                After receiving and reading Technoblade's will, Phil waited for
                3 months, under the assumption that Technoblade needed the time
                to extract information out of Dream during his stay in the
                prison, before he would attempt to break Technoblade out using
                his ender pearl in the stasis chamber of the Syndicate room.
                However, after he re-read the will, he panicked, seeing that
                Techno had written to activate the ender pearl after only a few
                days instead of 3 months, as he had originally assumed. He ran
                to the Syndicate and activated the ender pearl, teleporting
                Technoblade into the Syndicate room. After checking up on Techno
                and giving him a full set of netherite armor and tools, as well
                as a bucket of milk to get rid of the elder guardian's mining
                fatigue effect, he began to apologize for misreading the will
                and making him wait for so long. He took Techno back to the
                cabin, using a shortcut he had created involving an
                ice-path/boat transportation system, and began helping
                Technoblade gather up some extra materials through villager
                trades. When Techno explained how he had to go follow up on some
                information Dream gave him about a specific location, Phil
                offered to come with him as a back up, which Techno politely
                refused, explaining how Phil would "slow him down", as Techno
                was using Carl. Phil seemed offended at the comment, before
                going out of Technoblade's hearing range.

                  food so she doesn’t see it. He notes that there’s nothing
                  going on, mentioning Dream going silent and Tommy making a
                  plan, guessing that Tommy leaving him out of it was for the
                  best since he’d mess something up. He looks at the drawing of
                  Wilbur and wistfully comments that “he really loved that
                  nation.” He visits Ranboo’s house and checks on his animals.
                  Niki arrives and they start to bake.

                  After baking cookies, he hears a voice telling him to "get
                  out." He asks if Niki heard it and she says no, causing him to
                  immediately change the subject back to the cookies. The voice
                  comes back after he bakes a cake, saying "it's not safe."
                  Distressed, he drops the cake while looking around quickly.
                  Niki asks if he’s alright and he says he’s fine, that he just
                  needed to get some fresh air before running out of his cabin
                  and jumping in a puddle. He tries to reassure Niki that he’s
                  just tired and they go up to the bridge to decide where to put
                  the cake, the voice returning telling him to “run”. Panicked,
                  he jumps off the bridge and frantically asks Niki if she could
                  hear the voice. Niki says she didn’t and tries to calm him
                  down before a loud noise interrupts them.

                  Shortly after, Kristin appears at Ranboo’s house and catches
                  them both by surprise. Phil, ecstatic, runs up to her and asks
                  Niki if she can see Kristin while saying “she’s here”. Both
                  Niki and Kristin confirm that’s Kristin is real. Kristin
                  tiredly states that that it took her everything to visit them
                  in their world before greeting Niki by her name, much to
                  Niki's shock. Kristin explains that she watches over their
                  world. He quickly introduces Kristin and reveals that she is
                  the Goddess of Death, and that the two met a long time ago.
                  After he questions why Kristin appeared, Kristin told the two
                  they don't have much time and that she wouldn’t be able to
                  protect them against something destructive that was coming.

                  Phil explains that they have armor and weapons before Kristin
                  shuts him down, insisting that they need to head to the
                  nearest End Portal. Phil and Niki questioned what End Portals
                  were, much to Kristin's shock. As Kristin explains the
                  structure, Phil and Niki realize that she was talking about
                  the Syndicate meeting room table. Kristin responds in
                  exasperation when she finds out Phil and Techno turned it into
                  a table and asks the two to lead her to it. While Kristin gets
                  the items for the portal, Phil and Niki ring the sellout
                  timer. He gives Kristin an enchanted golden apple for safety
                  before entering the Syndicate’s lava pool entrance due to her
                  smaller/weakened state. They lead Kristin to the Syndicate
                  room where upon arriving at the portal, Kristin asks Phil for
                  an axe to destroy the table in preparation for its activation.

                  While Kristin preps the portal, Niki finds Connor, who
                  revealed that he was a ghost and was bound to a pink sheep
                  named Rosie. After activating the portal, Kristin urgently
                  reminds the three that they don’t have much time left and need
                  to jump into the portal. Phil asks about Ranboo and Michael,
                  and Kristin revealed that she made sure that they were safe
                  before meeting with Phil and Niki. With the confirmation of
                  Ranboo and Michael’s safety, Connor jumps in first with Rosie,
                  followed quickly by Niki. Kristin affirms to Phil that they
                  need to go and that everything would be okay before jumping
                  in. Phil stares at the portal for a moment before jumping in.
