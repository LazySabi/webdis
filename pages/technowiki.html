          <h2>Technoblade</h2>
          <p>
            Technoblade, also known as Techno, is the twenty-third member of the
            Dream SMP, joining on September 22, 2020. He is an anarchist opposed
            to government (as he considers them tyrannical and oppressive) and a
            co-founder of the Syndicate, a federation dedicated to upholding
            anarchist ideology. He is known for his dueling skills and prowess
            in battle.
          </p>

          <p>
            Techno allied with those who promised to help him achieve his goals
            of anarchy and the eradication of government. He first joined the
            server at the beginning of the Manberg Rebellion when Wilbur Soot
            and TommyInnit were exiled from Manberg and began planning to revolt
            against Jschlatt's rule along with the two by forming the faction
            Pogtopia. Techno spent weeks gathering resources to aid Pogtopia in
            removing Jschlatt’s administration. Techno and Pogtopia had a rift
            after he caused a mass murder during the Manberg Festival, during
            which he was forced to execute Tubbo. Some members of Pogtopia
            distrusted Techno, but he continued to aid their cause and
            encouraged Wilbur to pursue his TNT plot. At the end of the Manberg
            vs Pogtopia War, when Tubbo was declared the new president of
            L'Manberg, Techno felt betrayed that Pogtopia had instituted another
            government in L'Manberg. He spawned two withers and fought against
            the new administration. The withers, alongside Wilbur's TNT, blew a
            large crater in L'Manberg. However, the Tubbo Administration quickly
            began to rebuild L'Manberg.
          </p>

          <p>
            After the war, Technoblade retired, hurt by Pogtopia's betrayal and
            the institution of yet another government. He built a cabin in a
            distant tundra and swore off violence. However, after the Butcher
            Army attempted to execute him, Techno longed for revenge. He teamed
            up with Tommy after Tommy escaped from his exile. Together, they
            planned to regain the discs and get revenge. Techno then freed
            Philza, his longtime friend, from house arrest in L'Manberg. Techno
            admitted his plans to destroy L'Manberg to Tommy, and Tommy agreed
            to help him; however, Tommy soon rejoined L'Manberg instead. Techno,
            along with Dream and Phil, attacked L'Manberg by bombarding it with
            TNT and withers during the Doomsday War, permanently ending the
            nation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Following the Doomsday War, Ranboo joined Techno and Phil, building
            his own home nearby. Techno and Phil also founded the Syndicate to
            promote anarchy and diminish tyranny.
          </p>

          <p>
            He was imprisoned with Dream in Pandora's Vault, falling victim to a
            plan constructed by Quackity and Awesamdude, until being broken out
            by Phil using the Ender Pearl Stasis Chamber. Following Ranboo’s
            incarceration, Techno staged a prison break to empty Pandora’s
            Vault, freeing Dream, ConnorEatsPants, and Ranboo. After Sam killed
            Ranboo, Techno teamed up with Tubbo, rescuing MICHAEL and
            imprisoning Sam in Pandora.

            Technoblade is an anthropomorphic pig. He wears a crown, a white
            dress shirt, a red royal gown, grey pants, and black boots. He is
            generally drawn by fans and animatics as either a human wearing a
            pig mask/hoglin skull, a human with pink hair and a red royal gown,
            or a pig wearing royal attire that closely resembles his Minecraft
            skin. Notably, Technoblade has expressed his preference towards the
            more pig-like of these depictions, implying that this is what he
            considers to be canonical.
          </p>

          <p>
            Technoblade's winter clothing consists of a navy blue chest plate
            with cream-colored shoulder pads, black/gray boots, and a maroon
            undershirt.

              Technoblade is an anarchist who seeks the end of government and
              oppression. He fights for whichever side promises to fight against
              tyranny and allows him to use his weapons of mass destruction to
              achieve his goals. He does not care much for the interweaving
              loyalties of the other SMP members. Techno has stated that "the
              only universal language is violence," but will occasionally make
              grandiose speeches to other people to try and resolve things
              peacefully. However, when this does not work, Technoblade is quick
              to resort to violence.
            </p>

            <p>
              Technoblade is also a proud man and will show off his skills and
              equipment at any given moment. He claims to have mapped out the
              entire SMP in his head and calls himself the "Human GPS".
              Technoblade also has a lot of material possessions and is always
              on the search for the most powerful items on the server.
            </p>

            <p>
              Despite his violent and seemingly uncaring façade, he will do
              everything in his power to protect those he cares most about, most
              notably Philza. He also seems to hold remorse regarding his
              involvement with Pogtopia, wishing that Pogtopia and himself
              worked together to fight against tyranny rather than trying to
              establish another government. As an additive of this, Technoblade
              has an unwavering sense of loyalty towards his personal beliefs on
              anarchy. It is implied by his codename of "Protesilaus" in the
              Syndicate that Technoblade is more than willing to fight and die
              on the frontlines just so he can end what he perceives as
              tyrannical leadership.

            <p>
              After the Manberg vs Pogtopia War, Technoblade stated that he had
              given up his violent ways and retired far away in an arctic so
              that no one could find him, except for Phil, to whom he had given
              a compass that led to his base. He still showed no hesitation in
              defending himself, but was willing to leave L'Manberg alone after
              the war, and was trying to change from his violent ways. He
              started a bee farm and a turtle farm and seemed quite happy with
              his newfound pacifism. During this retirement, however, he had
              secretly grinded for more than a hundred wither skulls, which he
              kept in a secret vault. After being hunted by the Butcher Army,
              having his weapons stolen and sentenced to execution, Techno was
              forced out of retirement and returned to his violent ways to get
              revenge and destroy the L'Manberg government once and for all,
              becoming an "aspect of justice/balance." He stated that if people
              pay him with service and friendship, he will return that service
              and friendship tenfold. If they serve him injustice, he will repay
              the injustice with a thousand times the amount they served him
              with.

            <h3 id="flaws">Flaws</h3>
            <p>
              Technoblade’s main flaws are his loyalty, wrath, and pride.
              Technoblade is unwaveringly loyal to those he considers his
              friends and allies, and is willing to go to nearly any length to
              keep them safe. Earning Technoblade’s loyalty is difficult,
              however, and if Techno ever feels as though someone he trusted has
              wronged him, he holds an intense grudge. This leads to his wrath,
              as he often quickly and decisively strikes out to utterly destroy
              whoever he feels has wronged him and his friends. One of the most
              notable examples of this combination of loyalty and wrath is when,
              after feeling betrayed by TommyInnit, being almost executed by the
              Butcher Army, and having seen how L'Manberg had put Phil in a
              house arrest, he and Phil, along with Dream, completely destroyed
              L'Manberg.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another major flaw of Technoblade is that he is quick to resort to
              violence. Rather than trying his best to pursue a peaceful
              resolution through negotiations or bartering, he will hastily turn
              to extreme amounts of violence. These violent tendencies are often
              prompted by either his incapability of handling peer pressure or
              the voices in his head encouraging him to do as such. However,
              Technoblade frequently tries to disregard these voices and will
              almost always try to find a peaceful solution first, even if he
              quickly gives up on peace in favor of violence.
            </p>

            <p>
              Techno stands strongly to his beliefs. He truly believes that
              people are better off without the existence of governments.
              However, this can be seen as cruel, as his methods can cause
              immense pain for many as seen from past L'Manberg citizens such as
              Tubbo and Tommy. Adding onto this, Techno has an issue conveying
              his true feelings towards things that can make many people see him
              as overly prideful and selfish. An instance of him conveying his
              true feelings would be in his will, where he states that he hopes
              Tommy can find what he is looking for. This is a contrast from
              Techno saying that he despises Tommy for betraying him.
            </p>

            <p>
              An enduring flaw of Technoblade is his tendency to fall into
              pressure when situations are focused solely on him. When Jschlatt
              told Techno to execute Tubbo, he ended up bending to it and
              killing Tubbo despite trying to say he should not. In the Prison
              Break, Techno is pressured by Sam when he takes Ranboo hostage,
              which eventually leads to Ranboo's death.

              Technoblade was a great fighter, and he and Philza were and still
              are very close, being old friends. Phil mentioned Techno had
              suffered from voices in his head (his chat) ever since he was very
              young and that over time he grew better at ignoring them. In
              addition, Phil has alluded to his times in SMPEarth while on the
              server. He was the leader of the Antarctic Empire with Phil as his
              co-leader, and took over the entire server. To what degree this is
              canon is questionable, as Phil stated that his past with the
              Antarctic Empire is only a headcanon.

                Long before Dream SMP, Technoblade participated in Minecraft
                Monday, a weekly Minecraft competition featuring many games such
                as Hunger Games. In the first challenge, Techno attacked and
                defeated Quackity and his teammate. This led to Quackity
                developing a fear and a grudge at Techno.

                Technoblade lived and worked in Skyblock. Technoblade may have
                returned to Skyblock to usurp Dante, but the canonicity of this
                is unclear.

                After TommyInnit and Wilbur Soot were exiled from Manberg,
                Technoblade tweeted at the two asking if they needed assistance.
                This led to Technoblade joining the Dream SMP to aid in the
                founding of Pogtopia, aiming to destroy Manberg and abolish
                government. A misinformation campaign created by Jschlatt,
                implying Techno was a spy, sowed doubt and mistrust in
                Pogtopia's members. Technoblade denied these accusations,
                stating that if he'd truly been paid to kill Wilbur and Tommy,
                he would have done so already. The following day, Dream
                contacted Technoblade to show support and gave Technoblade
                supplies, including netherite ingots and an enchanted golden
                apple. Technoblade spent the next few weeks building a fearsome
                arsenal, which included new technologies such as a firework
                rocket launcher, a Riptide trident, and six wither skulls.
              </p>
              <p>
                As he collected an arsenal, he also collected pets and animals
                whom he cared for dearly, including Carl and two mobs wearing
                jack-o-lantern, Hubert and Fool (now Moon).

              <p>
                Technoblade was formally invited to the festival by Schlatt.
                Techno intended to gain intelligence through his investigation,
                but after Tubbo's speech, Techno was called up to execute him.
                Technoblade initially stalled for time, but after getting no
                further instructions from Tommy or Wilbur, he gave in to the
                peer pressure and fired his rocket launcher, killing Schlatt,
                Tubbo, and Quackity. In the chaos, he turned and fired upon the
                audience in order to give Wilbur time to try and find the
                button, instigating the Manberg Massacre. He stated afterward
                that he had killed Tubbo out of tactics, because if he hadn't,
                then all of Manberg would have killed him and taken his
                god-level items.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Pogtopia, Tommy confronted him for killing Tubbo, believing
                him to have betrayed their cause. Wilbur, siding with Techno,
                dug a pit for the two to brawl their emotions out in. Techno
                didn't hold any ill will towards Tubbo or Tommy, but agreed to
                the fight. When Techno won, Tommy continued to voice his anger
                at Techno, failing to recognize the reason behind using the pit
                for conflict. Finally taking things completely seriously, Techno
                told Tommy that the time for talking was over, reminding him
                that the only universal language is violence and that they
                already spoke that language in the pit.

              <p>
                After Dream's warning of a traitor within Pogtopia, many members
                returned to suspecting Technoblade, though he continued to
                actively deny it. On the day of the war, Technoblade led the
                others to his underwater base, revealing a hidden vault
                constructed of blackstone under the original base, fully stocked
                with gear for the whole army. With their new gear, the rebels
                confronted Manberg. They were able to force a surrender from the
                nation and looked on as Schlatt died of a stroke.
              </p>

              <p>
                After the death of Schlatt, Tubbo was chosen to be president and
                immediately set about reinstating the government. However,
                during Tubbo's speech, Dream reminded Techno of his anarchist
                goals, promising that he would support him if he rebelled.
                Shortly after, Technoblade assassinated Tubbo. He told everyone
                that he didn't spend weeks gearing up for the revolution just to
                replace one tyrant with another. As Techno, Dream, and Dream's
                allies turned on the new government with their weapons, Wilbur,
                the true traitor, ignited a cavern of TNT, blowing up L'Manberg
                and causing Ph1LzA to join the server. With the support of Dream
                SMP and the Badlands, Techno then gave a second speech declaring
                that power corrupts, and by abolishing the government, he was
                preventing another tyrant from rising. He compared Tommy to
                Theseus, a Greek hero who was exiled by the country he saved and
                died in disgrace. Techno then spawned two withers, further
                increasing the destruction.
              </p>

              <p>
                After the withers were destroyed and the survivors had met up,
                Technoblade threatened everyone who made any sort of reference
                to a new government. He explained that while Schlatt was a
                villain, he was still democratically elected; the new government
                performed a hostile coup and instilled themselves into power
                illegitimately. Despite this, they created the nation of New
                L'Manberg after Techno left, and marked Techno as a threat to
                their power.
              </p>

              <p>
                Later, Techno heard from Eret that GeorgeNotFound was the new
                King of the Dream SMP. During his coronation, Techno
                assassinated him as a warning not to get too comfortable with
                his rule.

                After the Manberg vs Pogtopia war, Technoblade found that his
                base and cow farm was robbed and vandalized by L'Manberg and
                their allies, making it unsafe to live near the country.
                Technoblade cut off contact from his closest ally, Phil, to
                protect him, and started to search for land for a new home. He
                stumbled upon a snow village in a barren snow wasteland and
                built a cabin to store his valuables and regain what was stolen.
              </p>

              <p>
                He eventually called on Phil a week later for help transporting
                his rare Halloween mobs and the sole remaining cow to his
                retirement home. After being helped, Techno then gave Phil a
                compass that would be able to lead to his base as well as a few
                emeralds as a token of friendship and appreciation,
                demonstrating a close relationship between the two. The two
                searched for turtles and bees and worked on farms together. In
                the passing days, Techno reflected on his violent past,
                realizing that much of his rage stemmed from voices in his head
                and that his violence harmed those around him. Because of this,
                he took on an oath of pacifism, aiming to be a good person.
              </p>

              <p>
                The closest he came to breaking his oath was when George
                mentioned Techno's cow farm to him. He interpreted this as
                George mocking him, as his cows were recently slaughtered,
                Techno hunted him down and came close to killing him (half a
                heart) before pulling back. This event was a major contributing
                factor to the Dethronement Fallout.

                an elaborate maze designed to trap and kill Techno so Awesamdude

                of his donators giving money every time Carl was shown
                onscreen), and was determined to retrieve him, but found a way
                around getting killed himself. He tricked Skeppy, a longtime
                friend, by saying that he had built the maze as a puzzle for
                Skeppy and had the latter enter the maze in his place, allowing

              <p>
                On December 16, 2020, the Butcher Army, a secret police force
                from L'Manberg aiming to execute Technoblade, made their move.
                They took the compass that led to Technoblade's cabin from
                Phil's home and placed him under house arrest. Phil secretly
                messaged Techno, warning him that the bounty hunters were on
                their way, which gave him just enough time to prepare. When the
                Butcher Army arrived, they stated that Techno was to come to
                L'Manberg to face trial. Techno pleaded for them not to do this,
                saying that he had changed his ways to be peaceful, but that he
                would not go back without a fight. When they failed to listen to
                these warnings, he caved into his voices, and killed Tubbo and
                Fundy, which was half of the army. However, Quackity stopped the
                fight by taking Carl, Techno's prized horse, hostage and
                threatening to kill him. To save Carl, Techno surrendered to
                their demands, dropping his armor, potions, and weapons, and
                coming with them. However, he secretly kept a totem of undying
                and was escorted back to L'Manberg, where it was revealed that
                it was not a trial at all, but an execution.
              </p>
              <p>
                In L'Manberg, Techno saw Phil under house arrest, and was filled
                with new grief and rage against the L'Manberg government. Techno
                was trapped in a guillotine while Tubbo gave a short speech.
                However, the execution was interrupted by Punz, who was hired by
                Dream, attacked the L'Manbergians and placed TNT on the podium.
                In the chaos, Quackity activated the guillotine, dropping an
                anvil on Techno. Techno equipped his totem of undying, allowing
                him to escape death and flee. Dream (who had sent Punz and been
                spying on the events) rescued Carl, met up with Techno, and
                pointed at a tunnel leading to the Final Control Room, which had
                basic gear for making an escape. Quackity managed to follow and
                confront Techno, where he expressed his hatred for Techno, his
                desire to accumulate power in L'Manberg, his plan to kill him
                right there. However, Techno managed to kill Quackity with a
                pickaxe and steal the majority of his items, escaping through
                the sewer system to his base. On his voyage back, he reflected
                upon events and realized that his pacifist vows could not be
                upheld. Technoblade then permanently broke his vow of peace and
                turned back to his violent ways.

                Upon arriving at his cabin, Techno found Tommy lurking in the
                area. Tommy then confessed to digging a small home under his
                base and leeching off of him after Dream destroyed his home in
                Logstedshire. After reclaiming some of his stolen items from
                Tommy, Techno proposed an alliance to help Tommy get his discs
                back and for himself to destroy the government through "minor
                terrorism." Tommy reluctantly agreed, and Techno revealed to a
                terrified Tommy yet another secret vault covered in dirt blocks,
                containing enough wither skulls to form 55 withers.
              </p>
              <p>
                After some work, Ranboo arrived. Techno distrusted Ranboo since
                he was part of the Butcher Army, but after Ranboo explained his
                thoughts and returned Techno's armor set, Techno allowed Ranboo
                to stay and help them. Together, they went mining for netherite
                with beds. At the end of the day, Tommy, Techno, and Ranboo
                bonded, listening to Tommy's Blocks disc while looking at the
                moon. After Tommy left, Techno told Ranboo that he had been used
                and explained his own experience of being used by Pogtopia. This
                line struck deep into Ranboo's heart, who realized that
                L'Manberg was only using him for their personal goals.

              <p>
                The day after the execution, Technoblade created a "December
                To-do List" of things that he wished to complete as part of his
                and Tommy's alliance. The list of goals read:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Get Tommy some weapons</li>
                <li>"minor" terrorism</li>
                <li>Get back my weapons.</li>
                <li>HOUND ARMY?</li>
                <li>Save Philza Minecraft</li>
                <li>DESTROY L'MANBERG</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Tommy and Techno performed a series of raids and covert missions
                in L'Manberg using invisibility potions, establishing a Hound
                Army in the sewers and determining where the Butcher Army kept
                Techno's gear, planning to take it back using aforementioned
                minor terrorism.
              </p>

              <p>
                One day, Techno received a direct message from Dream, stating
                that he wanted to talk to him in person. Tommy, who was still on
                the run from Dream, hid in a small box with an invisibility
                potion. After Dream arrived at his cabin, he told Techno that
                Tommy has gone missing. He searched around Techno's cabin, but
                did not manage find him. When Dream questioned Techno about
                Tommy's whereabouts, Techno did not betray Tommy and kept his
                mouth shut. They also discussed the events of Technoblade's
                execution, and Techno agreed that he owed Dream a favor due to
                his assistance.
              </p>

              <p>
                Two days later, Dream returned and spoke to Techno while Tommy
                was gone. After much stalling from Technoblade's voices, Dream
                revealed that he had known that Tommy was being sheltered by
                him, pointing to several very annoying and obvious things Tommy
                had done around the cabin. However, Dream chose not to take
                further action, as Tommy was still technically under exile, and
                warned Techno that one day his alliance with Tommy may break.
              </p>

              <p>
                After the conversation, Technoblade shifted the topic by making
                fun of Dream for not having a house on his own server. Dream
                denied the accusations and started building his own house
                nearby. Techno spied on him, watching afar and leading creepers
                to troll him. After much frustration, Dream destroyed the house
                and messaged Techno about the destruction, hinting at building a
                much larger one and revealing it later.
              </p>

              <p>
                Techno went on several solo missions into L'Manberg, where he
                rescued Phil from house arrest and made propaganda posters
                supporting anarchy. Phil moved to live with Techno and Tommy,
                convinced from his unjust house arrest that L'Manberg was
                corrupt, and Techno continued breeding his Hound Army. Ranboo,
                who felt guilty for his service in the Butcher Army, helped the
                anarchists cure zombie villagers as well.
              </p>

              <p>
                Techno and Tommy made several more missions into L'Manberg,
                retrieving Techno's weapons. They took Connor hostage, forcing
                the L'Manberg government to give back Techno's rocket launcher
                and his pickaxe, Technodrill. On their way back to their winter
                cabin, they were intercepted by Dream. Dream attempted to
                manipulate Tommy with his words, saying that Tommy had betrayed
                Dream by escaping his exile and hiding from him. Technoblade
                stopped Dream, stating that "he is with me." He explained that
                they were business partners and Tommy was under his protection,
                unless Dream wanted to call in his favor. Dream stated that he
                had something else planned for the favor, allowing them to
                leave. On their last mission together, Techno and Tommy withdrew
                three wither skulls and some soul sand to be used for leverage
                for Technoblade's sword, Orphan Obliterator, and possibly his
                trident or axe. The duo descended to meet Ranboo and Fundy and
                gave them an ultimatum: Techno summons the wither and attacks
                them, or he summons the wither, they return his gear, and Techno
                helps them kill the wither. Before they had a chance to decide,
                Techno summoned the wither. Ranboo rushed off to get the Axe of
                Peace and the Orphan Obliterator. After killing the wither,
                Fundy claimed the nether star, but Tommy and Techno quickly
                teamed up to terrorize him. In their interrogation, they
                discovered that a festival was happening tomorrow, and Tommy
                would have a chance to get his discs there.

                Techno and Tommy began to head back when Techno, looking at his
                companion, realized that he truly considered Tommy to be a
                friend and not just a partner. Techno then told the truth to
                Tommy, revealing his true intentions to destroy L'Manberg,
                leaving a smoking crater that could never be rebuilt. Techno
                gave Tommy a choice: Tommy could either follow in Techno's
                footsteps, help destroy L'Manberg, and get Techno's help in
                retrieving the discs; or he could leave Techno's care and get
                the discs himself. Tommy chose to follow Techno, but was very
                uncertain about his choice.

              <p>
                During the Green Festival, Tommy and Techno went to L'Manberg to
                crash the festival. When they arrived in L'Manberg, Dream and
                the Butcher Army were found to be accusing Tommy of destroying
                the Community House. There was a confrontation between Tubbo and
                Tommy at the ruins of the Community House, which led to Tubbo
                giving Dream Mellohi. Techno came to protect Tommy, promising
                that they could escape and recoup their losses, and that he was
                willing to cover Tommy's escape. However, Tommy decided to go
                back to the government of L'Manberg and Tubbo, betraying Techno.
                Dream revealed his true motives to Tubbo, and invited Techno to
                work together to destroy L'Manberg. Techno questioned if this
                constituted the use of the Favor, but Dream denied this,
                insisting that Techno would destroy L'Manberg whether or not the
                favor was used. Techno agreed and Dream then escaped from the
                many people surrounding them, with the latter soon following.
                The two discussed how to destroy L'Manberg, with Technoblade
                showing Dream his Second Vault - although, he only showed Dream
                18 wither skulls instead of the real amount, since he didn't
                fully trust Dream yet. The rest of the skulls were stored in his
                ender chest.

              <p>
                A few hours before the battle, Technoblade, Philza, and Dream
                were preparing, gathering resources to craft fireworks, potions,
                and other supplies for the fight. They later traveled to un-sit
                Techno's dogs. As they went back up to the surface, the
                L'Manbergian Defense Force soon found the three and alerted the
                rest of the force. Tubbo shot Techno, and the first blood spilt
                would commence the battle. Techno acted as a diversion while
                Dream set up the TNT that would rain down upon L'Manberg. As the
                battle progressed, Techno gave a signal to Phil - a firework
                shot into the sky - and Phil spawned the first wither. Another
                soon followed as the citizens and warriors fell into panic.
                Using this to his advantage, Techno dealt heavy damage to
                everyone. While the withers descended, Techno realized that he
                had Ranboo's memory book. He, Phil, and Ranboo met in Phil's old
                property, where the anarchists gave Ranboo the book, and allowed
                him to run away and be safe from the destruction, since they had
                no grudge against him.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the bombs began to fall, Techno and Tommy came to a short
                cease-fire. They screamed across the battlefield, each feeling
                as though the other betrayed them. Techno expressed how he felt
                as though Tommy only used him as a weapon, and never saw him as
                a friend. Tommy was still wearing the turtle helmet Techno gave
                for Christmas, and was holding the Axe of Peace Techno gave out
                of trust. Calling back to the Manberg Festival, Techno spoke of
                how Tommy and Wilbur never lifted a finger to protect either
                Techno or Tubbo and just watched, but at the Green Festival,
                Techno saw Tommy surrounded by everyone and was willing to fight
                the world to keep Tommy safe. As the nation crumbled, Niki
                burned L'Mantree, and Techno congratulated her on forging her
                own path. The war came to an end, and Jack Manifold attempted to
                duel him, but ended up at his demise.

              <p>
                After the nation fell and Techno's revenge was exacted, Techno
                and Phil returned home with the remainder of the dogs, talking
                about different farms and the life of anarchy. Dream chose not
                to speak with the anarchists afterward; their loose alliance
                ended with the desolation of L'Manberg and they went their
                separate ways. Remembering Ranboo, Techno and Phil agreed that
                they could give him shelter, but Techno wanted to keep his
                emotional distance after the last person he took in, Tommy,
                betrayed him.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ranboo was given amnesty and a permit to build a small house
                near a mountain where Phil would build a kennel for the dogs, as
                they eventually needed to move out of Tommy and Ghostbur's
                unfinished house. As thanks to Techno for letting him stay,
                Ranboo remade the Axe of Peace, which Tommy had lost in the
                fighting. Techno tried to act aloof and indifferent towards the
                gift, trying to preserve his "tough" image, but he clearly was
                touched by this gesture and Ranboo's consideration.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ranboo and Techno went on a journey to a woodland mansion.
                Techno brought along an elite task force from the Hound Army,
                dubbed the "Millionaire Dogs" as his donators had paid sums of
                money to give them specific names. Techno recovered two totems
                of undying from the journey.

              <p>
                After Ranboo revealed the location of a stronghold near Techno's
                base, Techno and Phil went on a small mission to explore it. The
                two wound up lost in the halls of the catacomb, but they
                eventually found each other and discovered a large room with
                twelve indestructible blocks forming a square (the portal room).
                The two did not know what to do with the portal blocks, so they
                decided to make a table out of it. They began building chairs
                and flattening out the room so that no one would fall into the
                pit of lava and die. They placed a sign behind the founder's
                chair that said: "Sic semper tyrannis." This would be the motto
                of the Syndicate, and it translates from Latin to English; "Thus
                always to tyrants." The two began to plan out other things for
                the room: pearl stasis chambers to teleport members into the
                room, water elevators for a quick exit, and converting the
                upstairs igloo basement into a secret entrance for the members
                of the Syndicate.
              </p>
              <p>
                The day after founding the Syndicate, Techno began his quest to
                recruit specific candidates. He decided that Niki would be a
                good candidate, but before he could send her a message, she sent
                him one saying she knew he was looking for her and asking where
                he wanted to meet. She sent a message of coordinates that led to
                her work-in-progress underground library and storage. Techno
                said he was impressed with Niki's boldness and resilience toward
                government on Doomsday and questioned her on anarchy. She
                replied by saying that all she knew about anarchy was causing
                destruction, terrorism, and chaos. Techno told her that there
                was much more to anarchy than just those three words, though
                they were a large part of the anarchist ideology. He told her
                that the real core of anarchism is freedom of choice, to be free
                of leaders and do what you want. Techno then asked if she wanted
                to be an anarchist, to which Niki replied by saying that she
                needed time to figure out what she was going to do, as she
                wanted to focus on her personal goals first of killing Tommy and
                Dream for lying and destroying her life. Techno asked her how,
                but she refused to tell him and Techno left, wishing her luck.

                CaptainPuffy, who was fighting against the Eggpire, began to
                consider speaking with Technoblade, as she had seen the trouble
                governments made between Eret's ineffectual kingship and the
                Eggpire's thirst for power. She received a secret message with
                the word "anarchy" and the coordinates to Techno's cabin, where
                she left "a note" (a literal note block) to indicate that she
                wanted to meet with him.
              </p>
              <p>
                BadBoyHalo, leader of the Eggpire, also wanted to speak to
                Techno. Bad went to Techno's cabin and brought him to see the
                Egg. Techno brought Steve, his emotional support bear, and
                Ranboo secretly followed them. When they arrived, Techno could
                hear the Egg speak to him, but it was drowned out by his other
                voices. Bad tried to entice Techno with promises that the Egg
                could give him the power to topple any government, but Techno
                pointed out that he already had that power, and the "Eggpire"
                seemed like a government.
              </p>
              <p>
                As they spoke, Puffy rushed to the Egg, where she was able to
                speak against the Eggpire. Bad discovered that Ranboo was spying
                on their conversation, and managed to trap Ranboo next to the
                Egg with the intent of brainwashing him; Techno quickly gave
                Ranboo his trident and an ender pearl, letting him escape. Now
                angered that Bad had threatened Techno's "associate," Techno and
                Puffy attacked Bad and suggested that he would blow up the Egg.
                Puffy and Techno officially named the group of people that Puffy
                has been leading against the Eggpire - "pro-omelette," before
                taking Ranboo and Steve back home to recover.

                Niki arrived at Technoblade's cabin to talk to Techno and Phil
                about the Syndicate. Techno agreed to let her in, and tells her
                about the goals, motto, and only rule of the Syndicate. Ranboo
                also watches from outside, but Techno catches him. Techno, Phil
                and Niki ask Ranboo if he is interested in anarchy and joining
                the Syndicate. He also agrees, and the four companions go to the
                upgraded Syndicate headquarters in order to have their first
                meeting. In this meeting, they talk about the Eggpire, Tommy's
                death, and also the existence of another nation. They end the
                meeting, and head out to find out more about this country. The
                Syndicate arrives at Snowchester, and asks Tubbo about
                Snowchester, who stated that it was simply a colony. Tubbo then
                showed Techno, Phil, and Ranboo the crater from the nukes. They
                then visit the prison before finally returning home. Whilst
                returning home, Technoblade expressed that he believed Tubbo was
                acting suspicious, but elected to ignore it since Snowchester
                did not seem tyrannical, unlike the Eggpire or L'Manberg prior
                to its destruction.

                Some time after the first Syndicate meeting, Techno was
                approached by Quackity, who wished to form a temporary alliance
                against the Egg. As it was a threat to both of their worldviews,
                they were able to temporarily put aside their history of
                conflict and work together. The two of them, along with Purpled,
                broke into the Red Banquet, where Techno deployed the Hound
                Army. They were able to drive the members of the Eggpire out and
                rescue the attendees, gaining control of the Egg; afterward,
                Quackity privately spoke to Techno and Awesamdude to discuss
                future plans.

                On June 1, Techno exited his cabin to find Philza, Niki, and
                Ranboo waiting outside to greet him. They set off a few
                fireworks, joked around and ate some cake. Philza decides to
                tell the members about Wilbur's revival which Technoblade took
                calmly. The four of them spoke about how Schlatt's return would
                be even worse and they brought up Ghostbur which caused Niki to
                freak out, but the others managed to calm her down. They then
                started to talk about the new risks of governments popping up.
              </p>
              <p>
                Midway through the conversation, Techno spotted Quackity in the
                distance, and excused himself from the table to talk to him.
                Quackity encouraged Techno to visit Dream in prison, mentioning
                the favor. Techno agrees to visit in the future, and then asks
                Quackity if he is lying, stating that he would hate to be lied
                to on his birthday. Quackity promises that he is telling the
                truth, and the two part ways.
              </p>
              <p>
                Techno goes back to the table to continue the celebration. Niki
                bakes him a pumpkin pie and together they throw shade at Wilbur.
                The rest then join them and they all have a fun time despite the
                tension in the air.

              <p>
                On June 6, Techno planned to visit Dream, telling Philza before
                leaving. Phil was not in support of the idea, saying that 50% of
                the people who visit the prison die. Before the departure,
                Technoblade handed Phil his will, which further increased Phil's
                doubt. But once he knew he couldn't change Technoblade's mind,
                he relented. Technoblade arrived at the prison and followed the
                usual entrance procedures. As he was on the platform towards
                Dream's cell, Dream panicked and told Techno that Quackity and
                Sam were working together in order to trap Techno in the prison
                with Dream. However, it was already too late. Sam told
                Technoblade that he could do with a "nice, long stay" for being
                the most likely person to rescue Dream and let down the lava
                flow, trapping Techno inside. Dream was extremely frustrated
                because the only person who could help him get out of the prison
                was now trapped in with him. However, Techno stayed calm and
                said he believed his friends would be willing to help him
                escape. He also tasked Dream with getting a book and quill and
                writing everything he knew about the prison. Dream was confused
                about Technoblade's upbeat attitude but did as he was told.

              <p>
                On September 14, Techno and Dream were visited in the prison by
                Quackity. Quackity told Dream that he needed the Revival Book
                and began to threaten him. He said that if Dream did not give
                him the book, he would kill Techno. However, Techno pointed out
                that Dream could just bring him back to life if he did so. He
                also indirectly voiced opposition towards Las Nevadas by
                claiming to oppose "whatever empire" Quackity had established.
                Quackity then threatened to kill the both of them, and told
                Techno to tell Dream to give up the book or else he would die.
                Techno did tell Dream to do so, but while shaking his head no.
                Quackity then gave up and decided to kill Techno, using a
                diamond pickaxe to remind Techno of how he had killed him
                before. However, while trying to do this, Techno was teleported
                to the Syndicate's meeting room by Philza. Techno was glad to
                have escaped, but annoyed because he had told Phil to teleport
                him after three days, not three months. Techno promised that he
                would break Dream out of prison and destroy it block by block.
                He then recovered his items and went to coordinates given to him
                by Dream, which led to the mountain where they had first met. He
                dug into the ground and discovered a chest full of blueprints.

              <p>
                The day before Techno planned to break Dream out of Pandora's
                Vault, Techno witnessed Ranboo's arrest and subsequent
                imprisonment by Sam, and so on November 28, 2021, Technoblade
                called a Syndicate meeting to break both Dream and Ranboo out of
                Pandora's Vault. After assigning each Syndicate member a role in
                the operation, Techno, Phil, and Niki reviewed blueprints of
                Pandora's Vault that Techno had obtained, before making their
                final preparations and leaving for Pandora's Vault.
              </p>

              <p>
                He made his way to the south side of the prison. A quick strip
                mine led him to the only exposed part of the prison, which was
                so deep underground it didn't need to be protected any more than
                its hundreds of gallons of lava. Navigating under, and through,
                Techno and Apollo (his new dog), swam with fire resistance
                through the prison's lava lakes until he found Dream's cell.
                Dream, in a moment or utter shock, had the brilliant idea to ask
                how Techno got in. Their chat was short-lived - Techno quickly
                came upon the conclusion that TNTing his way through was their
                only option and promptly blasted a hole in the wall, setting off
                the prison alarms in the process. The said alarms alerted the
                guards, and the duo made a run for it- and inevitably, unluckily
                ran into Sam and BadBoyHalo, who didn't really run into them -
                they were just hot on Dream's and Techno's heels and gaining.
                The four of them then more or less consecutively ender pearled
                through a lava tunnel; an epically short high school fight
                occurred in another room in which Bad got murdered brutally
                several times over and Apollo got demolished, thereby
                unfortunately not making it out for Techno to announce casually
                that he strolled in, took his dog for a walk, dragged Dream on
                the way out (probably, somewhere in there), and went back to
                sleep.
              </p>

              <p>
                Sam made it back to the Guard's prison room for whatever reason,
                and Techno used milk and TNT to announce his way through the
                prison. To everyone's surprise, ConnorEatsPants was in one of
                the cells on the way to Ranboo's; no one was even aware that
                Connor had been missing. Apparently Connor was brought into jail
                because of "stolen valor", which apparently is presenting a fake
                military id at Chick-Fil-A. Techno made the brilliant executive
                decision to bring Connor with them and stole Ranboo out as well.
                The four of them swam back through the lava and left through the
                hole Techno used to get in. Sam chased the four of them all the
                way out of Pandora's Vault.
              </p>

              <p>
                The second battle began when Techno, Dream, Connor and Ranboo
                left the prison and were ambushed by Eryn, Sapnap, Tommy, Punz,
                Michael and Jack. Everyone targeted Dream, but Sam tried a new
                tactic: taking Ranboo hostage. He was hoping to use Ranboo as
                leverage against Technoblade to get Dream to come back, but only
                the former cared what happened to him.
              </p>

              <p>Sam ended up taking Ranboo's last canon life as a result.</p>

              <p>
                Out of hatred, anger, and grief, Techno attacked Sam and Bad,
                screaming at them in disbelief. Niki summoned a couple of
                withers from far behind, confusing and distracting the others.
                As Niki tried to set off another Wither, she was ambushed by
                Sapnap, who managed to get her pickaxe, and she was forced to
                flee the battlefield. Phil joined up with the others and helped
                them to escape. Eryn pursued the escapees closely but eventually
                allowed Niki to escape in the Nether despite having an
                opportunity to stop her. He also later refused to disclose to
                his allies which route Dream, Techno and Phil took to escape,
                allowing the escapees to return to their base unmolested. Techno
                left not long after with a taste for revenge.

              <p>
                On January 29, 2022, Techno, Tubbo, and Eret headed to Sam's
                home to try and find the location of MICHAEL. Techno goes to
                meet Tubbo, finding the latter has lost most of his items. They
                then go to visit Eret, believing they had MICHAEL's whereabouts.
                While Eret didn't know where MICHAEL was, they knew Sam had his
                hand in MICHAEL's current location. The three of them then set
                off to find Sam. Techno and Tubbo make up, due to a stray remark
                that Tubbo had been killed by Techno. He has since apologized
                and Tubbo forgiven him.
              </p>
              <p>
                They manage to find the MICHAEL and Sam. After realizing
                everything that Sam has done, they decide to put him in his own
                creation. After doing so, Eret volunteered to stay behind to
                switch the portals so Tubbo and Techno could go, since they had
                a stasis pearl. Techno joked that they'd leave Eret in the
                prison, but the two of them activated Eret's pearl after they
                left.
              </p>
              <p>
                The trio set out to retrieve MICHAEL from Sam's house. They
                retrieve MICHAEL, dubbing themselves the Revengers, and head to
                Ranboo's house since Tubbo's had been ransacked. They then
                discover Boo waiting for them. Techno was confused by Boo's
                vague comments about being dead, but did not pry. After helping
                put MICHAEL away in Boo's home, Techno declared the three of
                them best friends. Eret and Tubbo agreed, the former calling
                their group "Based." The three head their separate ways,
                agreeing to remain friends.
